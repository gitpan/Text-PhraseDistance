Text::PhraseDistance - A measure of the degree of proximity of 2 given phrases


PREREQUISITES

This suite requires Perl 5; I have only used it under Perl 5.6.

Text::PhraseDistance does not use any nonstandard modules.


INSTALLATION

You install Text::PhraseDistance by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test (optional)
   make install

To install Text::PhraseDistance in the Win32 environment, use nmake instead of make.
nmake is available for free (in a self extracting executable):

After download and inflate, put nmake.exe and nmake.err in c:\windows\command 
or in c:\perl\bin .
