Version 0.02 : 2003/01/13

   Changed algorithm. Due to performance issues, the Branch and Bound 
   Depth Search First algorithm used to find the best distance is no 
   longer used. Now is used a "Stable marriage problem" algorithm 
   (thanks to larsen).

   Added cost to penalize the phrases that have less exact matches.

   Few minor issues.


Version 0.01 : 2002/08/13
